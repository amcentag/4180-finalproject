    For the final project, we designed and built a rhythm-based movement evasion game, inspired by the indie dungeoner <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/">Crypt of the Necrodancer</a>. We incorporated some key features of Crypt of the Necrodancer into our mbed version. For instance, music plays throughout the game. The player character can move once per beat, which follows the music and is also indicated by a flashing LED on the mbed. Enemies, scattered randomly throughout the floor, can kill the player and end the game if moved into. After reaching the staircase on the first floor and evading the boss on the second, the game ends.

    Mbed Crypt displays on a <a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/4180_1/notebook/ulcd-144-g2-128-by-128-color-lcd/">uLCD Board</a> and takes player input from a Bluetooth module connected to a smartphone. It also includes a two-player mode, where a second player traverses the map alongside the first and uses the other four buttons in the Bluefruit input on the smartphone to move. Screen captures of the two levels are shown below (the player character is the red music note). A demo can be watched above.
